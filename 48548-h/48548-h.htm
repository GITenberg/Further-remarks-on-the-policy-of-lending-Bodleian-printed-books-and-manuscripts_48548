<h2><i>Further Remarks on the Policy of Lending
Bodleian printed Books and Manuscripts.</i></h2>


<p>There are several reasons why it is in the highest
degree improbable that I should take any part in the
debate on the Bodleian Statute, but I reserve the right
to handle in my own fashion any arguments that may
be used, and to supplement, if need be, any facts or
supposed facts that may be brought forward during the
discussion.</p>

<p>Those who are in favour of changing the whole character
of the Bodleian, and who wish to convert it from a library
of reference into a library of circulation, do not seem
to feel much confidence in the strength of their case;
at all events, they have made no serious attempt to meet
the facts and arguments with which they are confronted,
but show a disposition to wander off into side issues of
little or no importance. Before examining the letters
of Mr. Sanday, Mr. Ellis, and Dr. Rost (as far as I know
the only advocates of lending that have yet ventured
into print), it may be well to add some further evidence
on the lending system, which was omitted from the
‘Remarks’ by inadvertence. The Advocates’ Library
is, as we all know, a lending library, and in 1852, or
thereabouts, the librarian informed Dr. Bandinel that
they had already <em>lost</em> nearly <em>seven thousand</em> works. In
1849 Mr. Maitland told a Committee of the House of
Commons that ‘all the ordinary readable books, for which
there is a great demand, are now reduced into a state
and condition so bad that it is perfectly disgraceful’; and
he was of opinion that ‘the only satisfactory and practical
reform in the Advocates’ Library would be to put an
end to the circulation of the books.’ Mr. Panizzi—a
splendid librarian and a man with a head on his shoulders—addressed
a string of queries to thirty-six large continental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
libraries, and asked, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter alia</i>, whether they lent
their books, whether those books were in consequence
lost or damaged, whether the practice was complained
of, and whether readers were inconvenienced by it.
Six libraries out of the thirty-six never lent under any
circumstances whatever; thirteen returned either no answer
or no clear answer as to the consequences of the practice;
<em>three</em> (the Public Library at Basle, the University Library
at Turin, and St. Mark’s, Venice) reported ‘no inconvenience
as resulting’; but the remaining <em>fourteen</em> told
a very different tale—from the Royal Library, Berlin,
‘few books were lost,’ but books were damaged; at
the City Library, Berne, ‘books do certainly suffer,’ and
readers are inconvenienced; at the Royal Library, Copenhagen,
‘many inconveniences are the consequences of
such a practice’; ‘books are lost, &amp;c.’—a very eloquent
‘&amp;c.’ especially if it be compared with the evidence of
Molbech the librarian there, see ‘Remarks,’ p. 59; at
the City Library, Frankfurt, ‘books are not entirely
lost, but are often damaged’; at the Public Library, Geneva,
‘books are lost and damaged’; at the Brera, Milan,
‘generally speaking books are not injured,’ but readers
are inconvenienced; at the National Library, Paris, it is
hoped that rules have been adopted which would ‘prevent
the great losses and just complaints of the public.’ (I may
parenthetically observe that forty years ago or more the
losses of this one library were estimated at <em>fifty thousand
volumes</em>); at St. Geneviève, ‘the principle is acknowledged
to be liable to many abuses’; at the Mazarene Library,
‘the system is found very dangerous’; at the Library
of the Institute, the practice was condemned as ‘highly
pernicious and practically liable to the abuses implied
in the question’; at the Ducal Library, Parma, books
are not lost and ‘few slightly damaged,’ but readers
complain of inconvenience; at the Imperial Library,
Prague, ‘readers were inconvenienced’; and at Wolfenbüttel,
‘all the inconveniences mentioned in the question
are the consequence of the system’; that is to say, books
were lost and damaged, and readers were inconvenienced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>I have said that the answer returned from St. Mark’s,
Venice (where lending on a very small scale prevailed),
was that no inconvenience was felt, but it is well deserving
of notice that the respondent continues thus,
‘<em>if librarians were asked all over the world</em>, <span class="smcap">and they
would candidly answer the question</span>, <em>one and all
would deprecate the system of lending, being liable to every
one of the abuses mentioned in the question</em>.’ Unfortunately
librarians, like other people, will not always answer
questions candidly. There is plenty more evidence of
this sort, but what has been already adduced here and
in the ‘Remarks’ is surely enough to prove the mischief
inseparable from this silly practice even to the most
obtuse of mankind.</p>

<p>Here too is a very significant fact, which ought to speak
trumpet-tongued to the Bodleian Curators. In 1827
Mr. Kerrich, the Public Librarian at Cambridge, possessed
an Arabic Manuscript (a history of the Berbers), which
was in the strictest sense of the word unique. In one
sense all manuscripts are unique, for no two are or
can be exactly alike, but Mr. Kerrich’s book was the
only known copy of the work in existence anywhere. He
was strongly urged to give or sell it to the University
Library over which he presided, but he utterly declined
to do either the one or the other, because the Cambridge
Library is a lending library. Few men, he said, know
the value of manuscripts; and he declared that there
were only two libraries in England where his book
would be open to the use of scholars and at the same
time safe, the British Museum and the Bodleian. This
manuscript now reposes on our shelves, and we got it
simply and solely because in 1827 (and for many years
after) we still possessed common sense. Kerrich would
never have let us have this unique volume, had he supposed
it possible that we should ever have been so forgetful
of our duty as to lend Bodleian books. We might
learn something from the Persians, who, as I was informed
the other day, on what seemed to be very good authority,
have a saying which runs thus:—‘The man who lends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
a book is a fool, but that man is a greater fool who
returns a book that has been lent to him’—a fearful
mixture of true with false doctrine.</p>

<p>Now for the letters, and as Dr. Rost is a librarian he
shall have precedence. His epistle will be found in the
<i>Academy</i> (March 5, 1887), and it is a real contribution to
the facts of the case. It is reducible to two statements:—</p>

<p>1. During nearly eighteen years there have been from
the India Office ‘thousands of loans’ and ‘there has not
been a single loss to record.’ In February, 1887, there
were ‘337 Oriental MSS. out on loan, 47 of which are
in the hands of scholars in India.’</p>

<p>2. ‘Numerous editions of texts and other works based
on our collections of MSS. would either have been impossible,
or at least not possible, to their actual extent
except for the existing arrangement.’</p>

<p>Here we have lending on a truly gigantic and imperial
scale, ‘thousands of loans’ and ‘not a single loss’: nothing
is said, however, about damage and deterioration, which
must have been considerable. Still ‘thousands of loans’
and ‘not a single loss’ is a mighty strong fact, so strong
indeed that Dr. Rost may be congratulated on a surprising
run of luck. But his marvellous good fortune is no
argument in favour of lending; it is rather an argument
against it. A man has been known once in his life
to throw double sixes four times running in a game of
backgammon; no other player, however, who has seen
this done need expect to do the like, for the chances
against him, if we merely consider the single and simple
chance, are more than a million and a half to one:
(strictly 1,679,615 to 1.) Dr. Rost has lent MSS. thousands
of times, and they have always come back safely,
not perhaps quite as fresh and sound as they went out,
still they <em>have</em> come back; let no other librarian expect
that the fickle goddess will treat him with like favour.
Consider for a moment the evidence produced above as
to the experience of other lending libraries, and you will
find it impossible to believe that the Bodleian can meet
with luck so entirely exceptional as that which has befallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the India Office. It is so uncanny that, were I Secretary
of State for India, I should certainly follow the example
of Polycrates, and sacrifice something very valuable, only
not a manuscript; the safest thing, however, would be
to stop the hazardous practice of lending, and tempt Fate
no more. The second part of Dr. Rost’s letter merely
re-echoes an argument used by Mr. Sanday and Mr. Ellis.</p>

<p>Mr. Sanday’s letter is printed in the <i>Oxford Magazine</i>
of February 23, 1887. He sees ‘two great, if not fatal,
flaws’ in my argument against lending out books. They
are: 1. that I ‘look only at one of the uses of a MS.,’
and 2. that I ‘immensely under-estimate the value of
the work that has been done upon MSS. in recent years.’
I plead an emphatic not-guilty to both these charges.
On what evidence do they rest? As to the first, the
evidence offered is that ‘my idea of a MS. appears to
be that it should exist beautifully, occasionally inspected
by a <em>connoisseur</em> who strolls down to the library purely
for his own amusement and with no further result worth
speaking of.’ Then I am told that a great number of
manuscripts are ‘valuable chiefly for their text,’ and
that when ‘they have been collated and the collation
thoroughly tested their work in the world is to a great
extent done.’ Very good: now let us dismiss as extraneous
to the present question manuscripts which are
‘works of art,’ and calligraphic or palæographical specimens
or curiosities, and then let me ask whence my kindly
opponent derives his information as to ‘my idea of a
MS.’? I am curious to know, because he certainly cannot
have got it out of my ‘Remarks’; he must have other
sources of information, only, I can assure him, that he
has been most woefully misled: in short, his notion of
‘my idea’ is wholly fictitious. That a great number
of manuscripts are ‘valuable chiefly for their text’ is
a proposition so self-evidently true, that it might have
been thought difficult to find any one out of a lunatic asylum
who ever doubted it. Will Mr. Sanday point out to
me in anything I have ever written any passage which,
by any interpretation however forced, could be made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
say that the great proportion of manuscripts are valuable
for much except their texts? In the greatest libraries—even
in the Bodleian—the number of splendid manuscripts—of
manuscripts valuable as works of art or as palæographic
monuments—is comparatively small.</p>

<p>But let us suppose the fiction to be a fact; let it
be assumed that ‘my idea of a MS. is that it should
exist beautifully’; how would that be a flaw in the
argument against lending Bodleian books? The argument—to
put it in its baldest form—is, that Nothing
that tends to damage a library ought to be done by
those who really care for it; but lending tends to damage
a library, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ergo</i>. <i>Minor probatur</i>: Whatever unnecessarily
damages the books tends to damage a library; lending
does so, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ergo</i>. Again, Whatever deters would-be benefactors
from giving books tends to damage a library; lending
does so; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ergo</i>, and so on and so on. The ‘Remarks’
can be run out into mood and figure with no trouble
at all. How is this argument or any part of it vitiated,
if I were to say (what I never have said), that ‘a MS.
should exist beautifully’? Let us clench the absurdity:
suppose I had been fool enough to say that no book
should ever be looked at in the library for more than
an hour a day; even that would not vitiate the argument
against lending books out of it. Have we forgotten in
this once famous University what a contradictory proposition
is? Have we as completely lost the art of
clear disputation as we have forgotten the use of the
rapier? There are times when I think so.</p>

<p>Come we now to the second flaw: I ‘immensely under-estimate
the value of the work that has been done upon
MSS. in recent years’. Suppose for a moment that I
do, how does that constitute a flaw in my argument?
It beats me altogether: I cannot see it. Do not lend
your books, says the argument, for five or six different
reasons; and I ask again with positive wonder in what
way any of these reasons are contradicted, even if I do
under-estimate the work that has been done on MSS.?
What has the one thing to do with the other? I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
understand it if it were impossible to examine a MS.
<em>in</em> the library; but that cannot be Mr. Sanday’s meaning.
Or does he mean this? If you do not let your MSS. go
out of the Library, and occasionally out of the country,
they will not be examined or collated at all? I hope
that this is not his meaning; for badly as I think of
the state of learning here, I have never thought so badly
of it as this supposition would imply. If after thirty
years of constant ‘reform’ we are sunk so low that we
neither can, nor will, use the treasures of the Bodleian
Library ourselves, why in that case I say let us give
the whole of it away to some country where scholars
are yet to be found. A library in which no man works—a
library such as the Bodleian is in the hands of men
too ignorant or too idle to use it—is dreadful to think
of. I, however, hoped better of the place, and I argued
that we should not send our books out of the library,
because—as one reason amongst others—it would then
be impossible for us to use those books in the library.
I wished to think of this University as still living, and
of its members as still lovers of learning for its own
sake, though I admit that this last effort cost me almost
all the faith I possess.</p>

<p>But I trust that I have completely misunderstood the
way in which my good-tempered critic would connect
my under-estimate of the work done on MSS. with the
argument against lending. All this, be it observed, is
on the supposition that I actually have under-estimated
that work; this I do not admit to be the fact, but whether
I have or have not it in no way affects the argument
against lending.</p>

<p>Mr. Sanday’s next point is, that if we do not lend
our books to foreigners, foreigners will not lend their
books to us, which will greatly inconvenience English
scholars; and, lastly, that it is a great inconvenience not
to be permitted to have Bodleian printed books in our
rooms. ‘The purpose,’ he says, ‘with which one borrows
books is mainly to <em>complete a collection</em>: one has, perhaps,
ten or twelve of the books one wants, but just some two or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
three are needed which no other library but the Bodleian
can supply’. What does all this amount to? Why,
that it is a great convenience to have books and MSS.
out of the Bodleian. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quis negavit?</i> Everybody admits
it; but the point—and it is really astonishing how few
people there seem to be now-a-days who can see the point
of any thing—the point is this: which on the whole is
the greater convenience to the greatest number of serious
students, letting books go out of the library or keeping them
in it? Never to lend entails inconveniences; lending also
entails inconveniences; on which side does the balance
of inconvenience lie? People feel, as Mr. Sanday confesses
that he feels, how convenient it is ‘<em>to complete a collection</em>’;
they never for one moment consider that their convenience
is another man’s inconvenience. Provided they can get
what they want, they really seem to care not one farthing
for anybody else in the universe. It is almost needless
to add that this remark does not apply to Mr. Sanday.</p>

<p>If we did not send our books abroad, it is certain that
foreign libraries might, and, if they were wise, would,
decline to lend us their books. And a very good thing
too. It benefits us to visit foreign libraries, and it will
benefit foreigners to visit ours. In these days of rapid
and cheap locomotion, there is less reason than ever for
sending books racing about all over the world. If you
go to Simancas, to Venice, or to the Public Record Office,
you may consult and copy the records of Spain, of Venice,
and of England, for yourself. If you had rather not go,
you can get attested copies of any document which you
desire to have, but you cannot borrow. And it should
be the same with all great libraries. If a man wishes for
a partial or a complete collation of a Bodleian book, or for
a complete transcript, he most certainly ought to be able
to get it accurately done, and I should hope that in this
University he would get it done gratis, though it would
be no hardship or injustice if such work were charged for
at a modest rate. If a man unable to visit us is willing
to pay for a transcript or collation, and there is no one
here either able or willing to make it, then there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
substantial grievance; but in no seat of learning ought
such a thing to be possible. In any University that
deserves the name, and especially in a University so richly
endowed as ours is, there ought to be, and if funds were
not wasted there might be, a number of keen-eyed men
skilled in every ordinary language of Europe and of Asia,
able and willing for the mere love of learning to do this
sort of work thoroughly well. It should be the same
in London. It is shameful to us as Englishmen, considering
what our Eastern Empire is, that there should
be the least difficulty in getting any MS. properly transcribed
or properly collated either here or at the India
Office. Let us reform ourselves in very deed, and not
in name only, as quickly as may be. Although a University
does not mean a place where the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">omne scibile</i> is either
known or taught, it is certain that such a University as
Oxford pretends to be (and might have been) ought to
contain even amongst its College fellows men skilled in
all but the most outlandish tongues.</p>

<p>Mr. Ellis’ letter appeared in the <i>Academy</i> of February
26, 1887. It consists of two parts more or less intertwined,
that is to say, of objections to opinions which he believes
me to hold though I do not, and of an attempt to justify
the lending out of books. The personal part (I do not
mean this in any disagreeable sense) has been answered,
so far as it required an answer, in the <i>Academy</i> of
March 5, 1887, and need not be repeated here.</p>

<p>Mr. Ellis thinks that the tone of my pamphlet ‘is,
to say the very least, reactionary’, and he describes me
as the exponent of ‘a reactionary movement against the
study and use of MSS.’ The pamphlet says in effect
that the Curators have for years past been doing a wrong
thing, and a thing for which they had no statutable
warrant; it gives reasons why the thing is both wrong
and foolish, and it begs the University to put a stop
to the wrong doing. This Mr. Ellis calls ‘reactionary’;
a violent misuse of an adjective, as it seems to me. Then
he makes out entirely to his own satisfaction, though
hardly, it is to be thought, to that of his readers, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
I object to the presence of an undergraduate in the
Bodleian. Anybody who reads the ‘Remarks’ with
ordinary attention will see that in the passage where
alone the word occurs (p. 46) it is used to denote a
species of the unlearned, and surely no one will deny
that it is rightly so used; for not one undergraduate
in five hundred could be properly described as learned.
But if any undergraduate is learned, I have never objected
to his presence in the library. How could I object when
I have said more than once that the Bodleian was founded
and endowed by learned men for learned men? Not
a year ago I introduced to the library a very young
Cambridge man, whom I firmly believed to be an undergraduate;
and I congratulated myself on having turned
loose into that glorious place exactly the sort of person
that Bodley, Laud, and Selden would have welcomed, for
he was at once a scholar and a lover of books. It turned
out that my young friend was not an undergraduate at
all, but a recently made Bachelor of Arts; but that
makes no difference as far as I am concerned; I believed
him to be an undergraduate when I offered to be his
sponsor. So much for the charge that I would exclude
undergraduates from the Bodleian. I would exclude
(just as Bodley ordered) all unlearned people, and therefore
almost all undergraduates; I would welcome all learned
men (and women too), and therefore any one, graduate
or undergraduate, who is learned; nor should I take
‘learned’ in a very strict sense.</p>

<p>Mr. Ellis declares that he should regard the change of
practice which I advocate ‘not only with grave distrust,
but with a quite lively resentment, as an outrage and
desecration’ to the memory of the late Mr. Coxe. I
understand this rather tall talk (and others do the same)
to mean that Mr. Coxe approved of the practice of lending
books and MSS. Now I have uncommonly good authority
for saying that Mr. Coxe viewed the lending system with
as much disfavour as I do myself. How could it have
been otherwise? Mr. Coxe was a librarian who knew
his business, and what the practice of such a library as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the Bodleian should be. The Curators, the greater number
of whom were profoundly ignorant both of books and
of book management, coerced him; he was obliged to
yield, but I am assured that he detested their barbarism
quite as much as I do.</p>

<p>The rest of the letter merely puts forward the plea
of convenience over again, and, like the rest, the writer
does not see that neither I nor anybody else have ever
questioned the convenience of the practice. I find that
some readers of Mr. Ellis’ letter suppose the sentences
in inverted commas to be all mine, but that is not the
case; several of them are expressions which he supposes
(wrongly enough) I should or might use. I have, for
instance, nowhere objected to the nasty habit of biting
your nails, though Mr. Ellis puts the objection into my
mouth. So long as a man merely bites his own nails,
I should say nothing, whatever I might think: it would
of course be different, if he were to try to bite my nails.</p>

<p>Every Member of Convocation has a right to criticise
the New Statute, and therefore no apology need be
made for the following remarks. For the first time in
the history of the Bodleian it is proposed plainly and
clearly to invest the Curators with the power to lend
books. From the foundation of the library down to 1873
they had no such power, no such right; nevertheless
from 1862 they did as a matter of fact lend manuscripts
and printed books. It was their custom, their ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mos</i>’
to do so. On February 28, 1873, they resolved that they
would ‘proceed <em>by statute to take power</em> to order the
lending out of books under certain restrictions.’ Now
no sane man resolves to ‘take power’ to do what he
already has a right to do. This resolution then was a
distinct confession that for years past the Curators had
been acting unstatutably, and it is probable, perhaps
certain, that the words ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sicut mos fuit</i>’ in the extraordinary
statute of 1873 were intended to cover and condone
the illegal acts of the previous ten or eleven years, an
intention completely frustrated by the unparalleled bad
Latin in which that Statute is expressed. Whether a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
permission ‘to borrow books for learned men’ conveys
to the Curators the power to lend them is very doubtful
indeed; if it were not so, it is difficult to see why the
Curators applied for the Statute now before us. Were
any one to maintain that the Curators have now no power
to lend books, and that they never have had it since
the Library was founded, he would not find much difficulty
in proving his case to the satisfaction of all reasonable
beings. The present Statute proposes to give them this
power, though not in perfectly unobjectionable terms.
For it first allows them to lend manuscripts, and then
declares that no rare book shall be lent without the consent
of Convocation. Now a manuscript is more than rare;
it is unique, no two being exactly alike. There is an
ambiguity here which will be found in practice to breed
endless difficulties. Then, again, who is to judge of the
antiquity, rarity, and so forth of any book, printed or
manuscript? Either the Curators must decide these
questions for themselves, or they must act on the judgment
of the Librarian. Knowing what it now knows,
is the University really prepared to say that the existing
board shall decide such questions; and, if not, is it ready
to leave matters so complex and difficult to the judgment
of any one man, be he who he may?</p>

<p>Lastly, the Librarian is permitted to lend books neither
rare nor valuable, and it is left to him alone to decide
whether a given book is or is not rare or valuable. To
those ignorant of books it will seem easy enough to settle
this question, though it is one to frighten a man who
does know something about them. Nothing is stranger
than the sudden way in which some books become at
first scarce, and then totally disappear. For nearly forty
years I have been on the look-out for two English books
which I read as a child; one a book of voyages and
travels, the other a cheap edition of the Arabian Nights,
and never once in all that time have I had a chance of
buying either: they seem to have vanished. One would
have said without hesitation that they were not rare and
certainly not valuable, yet they are absolutely unprocurable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
But this is a technical matter which will hardly interest
Congregation. It is more to the point to insist that the
rules for lending drawn up and approved by the Curators
should be revised and approved by Convocation, and that
without its consent they shall neither be altered nor abrogated.
Even so it will be impossible to prevent frightful
mischief. If the thoroughly bad principle of lending
is affirmed, is it not clear that the Paris rule should be
adopted? That rule is that <em>only duplicates of books
neither rare nor valuable</em> (the exact words of the regulation
are quoted in the ‘Remarks,’ p. 43) <em>shall be lent</em>.</p>

<p>But it is to be hoped that the University will follow
the excellent example of the British Museum. The
Oriental Congress have been moving heaven and earth to
get the Trustees to sanction the loan of Oriental Manuscripts
‘under proper guarantees,’ and they have brought
considerable pressure to bear; but the Trustees, as well
as the responsible officers in the Museum, have given
the Oriental Congress its answer. The authorities in Great
Russell Street know their business, and they utterly decline
to lend on any terms. Let us be as wise as they
are. If the present Statute is passed, no one can be so
foolish as to suppose that it will be long obeyed, or that
it will not be soon relaxed. The question really is between
lending and not lending. The lending, if sanctioned in
any form, will at first be limited, it will rapidly become
unlimited. A rat-hole in a dyke lets the water in at first
in a dribble, then in a stream, finally away goes the dyke
and irreparable mischief is done. So will it be with
lending, only that the dyke which defends the Bodleian
will be bored in an indefinite number of places. Every
borrower will act the part of a rat. The borrowers’
list which this Statute legalizes for the first time will
soon embrace the name of every graduate in Oxford.
It is so convenient to have the exact book you want in
your own room. Yes, unquestionably most convenient;
but what is the price you pay for this convenience? A
ruinous one; you destroy the Bodleian as a library of
reference. ‘Once or twice a year,’ says Mr. Warren (see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
<i>Academy</i>, March 12, 1887), ‘graduates like myself go
up to Oxford on a short visit with pages of references
to verify, anxious to see new or back numbers of the
<i>Revue Celtique</i>, Palæographical Society publications, &amp;c.
It is both inconvenient and disappointing to be told, as
I have been told more than once, that such-and-such a
book is out on loan, and cannot be had. The inconvenience
will become greater as the circle of privileged borrowers
becomes larger’; this is the language of a student, and
the language of common sense. The benefit of a reference
library cannot be exaggerated, and it must be clear to
the meanest capacity that lending and deposit cannot
possibly be combined. It is not difficult to damage or
destroy the usefulness of the Bodleian, and the Statute
on which we are now to vote is the first step downwards.
To lend books out of such a library as ours is an act
opposed to the teachings of experience, nor can it be
said that the course which we are invited to take is one
sanctioned by those who are eminent authorities on such
a question. The men who for years past have been persistently
trying to force this fatal policy upon the University
may be remarkable on more accounts than one; yet they
are assuredly not remarkable either for their acquaintance
with books and libraries, or for their knowledge of the
Bodleian. To them it is merely a large library, not essentially
different from the London Library or from Mudie’s,
and they propose to treat it accordingly. No mistake
can be greater. The Bodleian is no ordinary library;
it is one of the wonders of the world, and are we going
to be such Vandals as to sanction a practice which can
only end in its destruction?</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
